Secure computing requires the secure design, implementation, and use of systems and algorithms across many areas of computer science. Fundamentals of secure computing such as trust models and cryptography will lay the groundwork for studying key topics in the security of systems, networking, web design, machine learning algorithms, mobile applications, and physical devices. Human factors, privacy, and the law will also be considered. Hands-on practice exploring vulnerabilities and defenses using Linux, C, and Python in studios and lab assignments is a key component of the course.
